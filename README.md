# Analysis of Current Trends in the Movie Industry

#### Lynn Anderson

## Overview
A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

Microsoft wants to enter the film industry and start producing original video content. However, the company doesn't know where to start- they need to know what types of films are most profitable and popular, in order to know where to focus their efforts and investments. To ensure their success in the industry, they will need to produce films that consistently provide a substantial return on their investment. 
The purpose of this project was to use exploratory data analysis to determine some characteristics of films that resulted in the highest return on investment. I chose return on investment as the metric for success because other metrics- for example net profit, ratings, or popularity, do not accurately portray to what degree that film was financially beneficial to the company. As a start to help Microsoft with their decision regarding what types of films to produce, I analyzed what size production budgets, which genres, and what directors are associated with films that have been successful in terms of return on investment. Exploratory data analysis of databases from The Numbers (which contains records for top permorming movies) and the IMDB database (which contains information for over 80,000 movies) was performed to identify trends and generate insights on  the types of films that are likely to result in the success of Microsoft's business. 

Based on the results of the analysis, my reccomendations are to produce more films with a modest budget,
to emphasize producing content belonging to the most successful genres, and to recruit directors who have a reputation for producing successful films. 

## Business Problem:

Microsoft wants to enter the film industry and start producing original video content, and have decided to create a new movie studio. However, the company doesn't know much about creating movies. As a start, they need to know what types of films are are most profitable and popular, so they spend their time and budget wisely. By analyzing trends in what types of movies have been most successful, we can gain insights into the allotted budget and type of films to create.


## Data Understanding
The data analyzed was sourced from from The Numbers, which contains records for top permorming movies based on the domestic and worldwide box office, and from the IMDB database, which contains information for over 80,000 movies. After combining 4 different databases, I had records from 2123 different movies.


## Data Preparation

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Visualization


# Conclusion

Produce more films with a modest budget, rather than pouring a substantial amount of resources into a single film.
Focus on the most popular genres- Thriller, Fantasy, Action, Adventure, and Animation.
Reach out to popular, top rated directors- many consumers pay attention to who produces great films, and if we choose well-known, reputable directors to create our films, consumers will be more likely to watch films by a new production company.

## Summary 
Production budgets which correlated in highest Return of Investment (ROI)
Most popular genres
Directors who produced popular, top rated films



## Next steps and further research
Identify and correlations between which genres and directors are associated with the films having the highest ROI. More research should also be done to determine what actors and film crew are associated with successful films. Finally, I recommend we also look into correlations between ratings and profit- are highly rated films indeed more profitable?Or is the audience drawn in by initial impressions such as the genre, director, and film crew?
